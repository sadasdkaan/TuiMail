## Test Statistics

### Current Test Count (Updated)
- **384 total tests** across all test files
- **245 passing tests** (+25 improvement)
- **139 failing tests** (-25 improvement)

### Major Improvements Made
- âœ… **EmailViewer tests**: All 31 tests now passing (was completely failing before)
- âœ… **Fixed component prop issues**: Resolved missing folders, emailService, and callback props
- âœ… **Improved mocking**: Added proper mocks for useResponsiveLayout and useTouchFriendly hooks
- ðŸ”„ **ComposeForm tests**: Still need fixes for form validation and submission logic
- ðŸ”„ **Integration tests**: New comprehensive tests created but need component fixes to pass
